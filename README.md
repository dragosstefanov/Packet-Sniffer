# Packet-Sniffer
A Python packet sniffer.

This is a Python packet sniffer from a Cybrary course. The file contains comments which are used as notes.
I found that this program really helped me understand how internet packets function and hope the comments will be helpful for anyone else who is trying to learn how communication between devices works.
